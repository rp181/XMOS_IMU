 * UART TX server function. 
 * This function never returns and the arguments specify the initial configuration of parity, bits per byte etc.
 * These are checked and then the inner UART TX loop (uart_tx_impl() is started and runs in a while(1) loop until 
 * it receives and instruction to shut down via the channel from the client. Additionally a set of client functions 
 * are provided to transmit a byte and to alter the baud rate, parity, bits per byte and stop bit settings. Note that
 * the buffer size can only be changed when this function is first called, it cannot be changed thereafter.
 *
 * The client provides data to the server using the send byte function below.
 * 
 * Arguments are as follows:
 *
 * \param txd          Transmitted data signal. Must be a 1-bit port.
 * \param buffer       Array for buffering bytes before they are transmitted.
 * \param buffer_size  Size of the \a buffer array.
 * \param baud_rate    Initial baud rate.
 * \param bits         Initial bits per character. Must be less than 8.
 * \param parity       Type of parity to initially use. No parity bit is transmitted if \a UART_TX_PARITY_NONE is passed.
 * \param stop_bits    Initial number of stop bits to transmit.
 * \param c            Chanend to receive requests on, where a request is either a byte to transmit or a configuration change.
